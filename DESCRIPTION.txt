Description: Personalized assignment to one of many treatment arms via regularized and clustered joint assignment forests as described in Ladhania, Spiess, Ungar, and Wu <arXiv:2311.00577>. 
	     It considers a regularized forest-based assignment algorithm based on greedy recursive partitioning that shrinks effect estimates across arms and incorporates a clustering 
             scheme that combines treatment arms with consistently similar outcomes.
